## Url routing
| 		                      			| URL                                                                |

## Requirements

- Create a web app in angular latest stable version

- The parent component must have two child components:
	- One for retrieving the live data about all currencies
	- Another one for retrieving the market overview
- By clicking any currency of the 20 shown on the parent component, it should redirect to the url for showing the currency information
- Use angular routing to show one component or another inside its parent, follow the Url routing above
- Avoid to put unnecessary logic inside the component, and try to not duplicate code
- Add Unit Tests that covers the functionality
- We must consume the following apis for retrieving the value of a cryptocurrency:

### For retrieving the information of a currency:
https://api.kucoin.com/api/v1/market/stats?symbol={code of the cryptocyrrency}-USDT example: https://api.kucoin.com/api/v1/market/stats?symbol=BTC-USDT
